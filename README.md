#  Event Page Web App

A simple, responsive frontend web app that displays a list of featured events. The event data is dynamically loaded from a local JSON file. The project also includes a basic **Login** and **Signup** page as an extra feature.


##  Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the pages  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Dynamic event loading  
- **JSON** – Event data source (`events.json`)  
- **Local Assets** – Images and icons  

##  How to Run the Project Locally

> Since JavaScript `fetch()` cannot read local files directly due to browser security (CORS), the project must be served through a local web server.

You can use **either of the following options**:

### Option 1 – Run with Python (if Python is installed)

1. Open Command Prompt or Terminal
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/event-page
Open your browser and go to:

http://localhost:3000
✅ Option 2 – Run with Live Server (in Visual Studio Code)
Open the project folder in VS Code

Install the Live Server extension (if not already installed)

Right-click index.html and select "Open with Live Server"

The project will open in your browser automatically
